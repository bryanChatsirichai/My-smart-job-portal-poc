"""Job source adapter protocol.

Each external job API implements ``JobSourceAdapter`` with two responsibilities:

1. ``fetch_jobs`` — retrieve a page of raw records from the upstream API.
2. ``normalize`` — map one raw record into ``CanonicalJobInput`` for DB upsert.

The sync worker (`app.worker.sync`) paginates through adapters using
``FetchParams`` and persists normalized rows via ``upsert_job``.
