Reference documentation for how the Smart Job Portal POC works today.

## Architecture

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Job ingestion](architecture/job-ingestion.md) | How jobs are gathered from external APIs, normalized, stored in SQLite, and served to the frontend |

## Development guides

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [SQLite viewer (Mac & Windows)](development/sqlite-viewer.md) | Open and inspect `backend/jobportal.db` during dev and testing |
| [LinkedIn scraper setup](development/linkedin-scraper.md) | Run the self-hosted scraper and sync LinkedIn listings |
| [Local PostgreSQL (optional)](development/postgres-local.md) | Docker Postgres for future scale — not required for the POC |

## Job source adapters
